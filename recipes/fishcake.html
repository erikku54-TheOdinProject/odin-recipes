    <h1>Proper British Fish Cakes</h1>

        <p>As you might know, I'm a big fan of the Great British Baking Show, or "Bake Off" as Mary Berry would call it, and I've posted many dessert videos over the years inspired by things I've seen these famously cheerful contestants make. It was one of my favorite go-to programing choices when surfing Netflix, but eventually I ran out of episodes, and I've been patiently waiting for new shows to air.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, while enjoying a free trial on Hulu, I stumbled across a similar show, focusing on savory foods, called Britain's Best Home Cook. It has everything I love about the GBBS, including Mary Berry, and a whole new, TV-based culinary muse was born. This British fish cake is the first offering inspired by this very entertaining, feel-good show.</p>
        <p>I'm a huge fan of fish, mashed potatoes, and crispy fried things, so it's no surprise this is one of my favorite things to eat, and whether it's done in pan, or deep-fryer, I can't get enough of this comforting classic. The easy technique will work no matter what type of fish, or seasonings you use, but whether you make your own version, or follow this recipe verbatim, I really do hope you give this (and the show, if you haven't seen it) a try soon.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Step 1</li>
            <p>Mix mayonnaise, capers, shallot, parsley, tarragon, horseradish, mustard, and cayenne together in a bowl for tartar sauce and refrigerate until needed.</p>
            <li>Step 2</li>            
            <p>Add milk and bay leaf to a saucepan and place the pieces of fish over the top. Season with salt. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, and cook for about 1 minute, stirring occasionally. As soon as the fish firms up, but before it starts to flake apart, turn off the heat and cover. Let sit for 5 minutes before draining. Let cool, about 10 minutes. Refrigerate until needed.</p>
            <li>Step 3</li>
            <p>Meanwhile, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add russet potato and boil until tender but not falling apart.</p>
            <li>Step 4</li>
            <p>Drain and mash potato in a bowl. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne. Add parsley, chives, and lemon zest; add 1 tablespoon tartar sauce mixture. Mix until combined. Flake chilled fish over the top. Mix until combined.</p>
            <li>Step 5</li>
            <p>Scoop out ¼ of the mixture and form into a patty. Repeat with remaining mixture.</p>
            <li>Step 6</li>
            <p>Dust cakes with flour on both sides. Brush both sides of cakes with beaten egg. Coat in bread crumbs.</p>
            <li>Step 7</li>
            <p>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry patties in the hot oil until golden brown and heated through, 3 to 4 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels before serving with tartar sauce.</p>
